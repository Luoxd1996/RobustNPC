# RobustNPC
*Deep learning-based accurate and robust delineation of primary gross tumor volume of nasopharyngeal carcinoma on heterogeneous magnetic resonance imaging: a largescale and multi-center study*

## Notes
* This work was modified from [nnUNet](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet).
* Due to data privacy protection, we can not release the five hospital datasets, but we released the trained our proposed-framework for new data prediction.

## How to use
